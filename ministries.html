                    <h1>Ministries</h1>
                    <div class="sectionline"></div>
                    <p><br><h4>Intercessory Ministry</h4>

                        The Intercessory Ministry consists of prayer warriors and mediators who continuously present the
                        praises and petitions of the church, its members, and the community before God's throne.<br><br>

                        <h4>Evangelism Ministry</h4>

                        The Evangelism Ministry has a twofold mission: actively spreading the gospel of Christ to
                        non-believers and uplifting and strengthening fellow believers. This ministry is dedicated to
                        both reaching out to the lost and nurturing the faith of believers.<br><br>

                        <h4>Engineering Department</h4>

                        The Engineering Department serves as an overarching ministry responsible for the technical
                        aspects of church operations. This includes maintaining and ensuring the proper functioning of
                        all electronic and electrical equipment used during services, managing in-house recording studio
                        facilities, recording and reproducing messages, and overseeing information systems within the
                        church.<br><br>

                        <h4>Drama Group</h4>

                        The Drama Group's objective is to convey the message of Jesus Christ through theatrical
                        performances, drama sketches, and movies, effectively using the medium of drama to reach people
                        with the gospel.<br><br>

                        <h4>Choir Ministry</h4>

                        The Choir Ministry leads the congregation in worship through songs and special music during
                        church gatherings. Their role is to create an atmosphere conducive to spiritual encounters, as
                        stated in Psalm 22:3, where God inhabits the praises of His people.<br><br>

                        <h4>Search The Scriptures Department</h4>

                        The Search The Scriptures Department, led by Sunday School Teachers, focuses on deepening the
                        biblical knowledge of church members. Teachers prepare engaging Bible teachings to help
                        believers understand and apply God's word effectively.<br><br>

                        <h4>Ushering Ministry</h4>

                        The Ushering Ministry welcomes worshippers, assists them in finding seats, and ensures their
                        comfort during church services. They also maintain order and minimize distractions to facilitate
                        a conducive atmosphere for worship.<br><br>

                        <h4>Follow-up Department</h4>

                        The Follow-up Department concentrates on nurturing new converts in the congregation, providing
                        them with support, guidance, and church information to help them grow in their faith.
                        Additionally, they reach out to existing members who have been absent for some time.<br><br>

                        <h4>Hospitality Ministry</h4>

                        The Hospitality Ministry extends warmth and care to visitors and new members, offering them
                        support and church information. They also conduct physical visits to members in need of
                        encouragement and prayer.<br><br>

                        <h4>Publications Ministry</h4>

                        The Publications Ministry produces literature that promotes commitment to Jesus Christ and
                        reflects His lordship in daily life. This includes publishing Sunday service bulletins and other
                        materials that communicate the church's vision and values effectively.<br><br>

                        <h4>Security and Valet Department</h4>

                        The Security and Valet Department ensures safety and orderliness outside the church premises.
                        They oversee parking lot management, safeguard members' vehicles and properties, and prioritize
                        the security and well-being of all worshippers.<br><br>
